        Horizon's End is a community-built space-based Minecraft server, which
        utilizes server-side code to allow for movable starships which you can
        build yourself. We have many other features such as settlement/nation
        mechanics, sci-fi combat, factories, and base defense.
    
        Be sure to familiarize yourself with the rules and information below. We
        are an English speaking server. Please be sure to keep your messages in
        English for ease of communication.

        As a Community server, we adhere to the Discord
        [Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines) and
        [Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/terms).

        A shortened version of our rules are listed below. These rules are
        global. They are subject to change at any time, and we will do our best
        to inform the community of each instance. Ultimately, it is the players
        responsibility to stay up-to-date with the rules.
