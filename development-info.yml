            The repository includes a [script](https://github.com/HorizonsEndMC/Ion/blob/main/testServer) that will create a test server, and configure the plugin.
            On Mac or Windows, you will need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Linux users can install docker with the package manager of their choice.
            After that, simply sh testServer setup; sh testServer start, to get it running.
